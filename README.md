A simple music display skin for Rainmeter. It has support for the most-used players, including Spotify. It also features smooth scrolling text! Just pick a song with a very long title and see what happens. You can disable it to save resources (recommended on laptops) if you want to.

As always, right-click the skin and hit "Settings..." to change the settings.
